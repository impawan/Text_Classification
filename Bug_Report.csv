The incorrect operation history is presented to the user until the next undoable change is made in the diagram editor.\n\nThe problem is that the GlobalUndoAction (and GlobalRedoAction) creates a new Eclipse UndoActionHandler delegate whenever the workbench part changes.

41712,AJDT,Doc ,Adrian Colyer,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'After downloading this plugin, performing the (important) post- installation \noperations, and attempting to use the plugin, I have yet to successfully \ncompile and run a program with aspects. I have attempted to (a) create a new \nAspectJ project and import an existing project to it," and (b) create an AspectJ \nproject from scratch. It is unclear from the behavior of the plugin whether or \nnot things are working properly; for example when I create a new AspectJ \nproject I see the same wizard as for a ""regular"" java project", and I see \nnothing indicating which .java files an aspect should be compiled with, no \nother aspect- related data is requested, or anything else that indicates that I \nam creating a project that is different from a regular java project. \nFurthermore," despite the fact that the AspectJ compiler was set as the default \n(as specified in the ""Post Installation Customization"" section of your release \nnotes)", I am still getting java compiler errors when I attempt to compile an \naspect (for example," keyword ""aspect"" is unknown!).\n\nThe UI tools don\'t seem to do anything", either. I activate them in an AspectJ \nproject and don\'t see anything indicating that they have any functionality \nother than displaying blank screens.\n\nWithout a coherent set of documentation including installation instructions, \nproper post- installation instructions," basic ""how to set up a project"" \ninstructions"," ""how to use with the rest of Eclipse"" instructions", and (most \nimportantly) troubleshooting instructions, I cannot know what to expect when I \ncreate and attempt to compile an AspectJ project. Because I don\'t know what to \nexpect in an AspectJ project, I cannot tell if the AspectJ- related \nfunctionality is working properly. Because I cannot tell whether or not it is \nworking properly, I cannot figure out if I am doing something wrong when I \nattempt to create, compile, and run such a project and fail. The bottom line is \nthat without proper user documentation for this plugin, I, my coworkers, and my \ncompany\'s client developers are unable to use this plugin. Unless and until \nsuch documentation is created," we will turn our attention away from both the \nAJDT plugin and (in the case of many of our clients who would only use Eclipse \nfor the plugin) Eclipse itself.\n\nUpon examination of your ""list of tasks"" page", I discovered that you are aware \nof this lack of documentation, but have no one assigned to deal with this \nproblem. I also have an intimite understanding of the problems involved with \nhaving too few people to handle all the tasks that you want to handle. \nUnfortunately, I strongly suggest that if you plan to have this plugin used by \nany significant number of people besides those who developed it, you might want \nto consider raising the priority of docmentation. While it will be nice to add \nsome of the functionality that you people are planning to add to this plugin, \nall the nice functionality in the world will be useless if people don\'t know \nhow to set up your plugin, use it, or troubleshoot it if things go wrong with \nthe installation. Without decent user documentation you\'ll have a very nice, \nfull- featured, and *unused* piece of software.\n\nJust so that you know that I am a doer, not a whiner, I actually considered \nputting together some user documentation and contributing to your project. \nUnfortunately, my experience with this plugin has demonstrated that I do not \nknow enough about its operation to do so. I cannot even get it to work on my \nown machine; I simply am not qualified to write any documentation about this \nplugin. Be advised that I am still willing to devote time to writing such \ndocumentation -- provided that someone knowledgeable in the use of the AJDT \ntakes the time to get me up to speed. Get me to the point that I can use the \nprovided tools, and I will cheerfully contribute a version of my documentation \nto the project.\n\n-Robert Brown III',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This behaviour is controlled\nby the sameDoc() method of TextMergeViewer which determines if the\nIDocument instances associated with the left", right, and ancestor\nlegs are the same for both the old input and the new input.\n\nThis method uses getDocument() for each leg, which in the case of\nan IStreamContentAccessor input, asks the DocumentManager for a\ncached working copy.  For the old input, this is fine since the\nDocumentManager still contains the old working copy.  For the new\ninput, however," this usually returns 'null' because no copy has\nyet been cached.\n\nSo in this case sameDoc() will always return 'true' for each leg!\nHence the user will never be prompted to save changes and sometimes\nthey will be lost.\n\nThis is a serious issue for VCM because many of its components are\nbuilt around IStreamContentAccessors and exhibit the problem.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It must verify that the\n   property name is CompareEditorInput.DIRTY_STATE.  At the moment\n   it will be fooled by any other boolean property.\n\n2) The dirty state listener should keep track of which viewers are\n   dirty so that it can determine when the CompareEditorInput instance\n   itself should be considered dirty/non-dirty.  The simplest solution\n   is to add a viewer to a List when a DIRTY_STATE property change is\n   received from it with value true, and to remove it from that List\n   when a DIRTY_CHANGE property change is received from it with value false.\n   isSaveNeeded() would then return true iff the list was empty.\n\n3) findContentViewer() adds an extra SWT.Dispose event listener\n   to the viewer's top-level control each time a viewer is recycled\n   (not serious," but wasteful).""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It will crash immediately. \n\nThis is extremely serious, since it will continue to happen unless you delete \nthe Help metadata (.metadata\\.plugins.\\org.eclipse.help.ui). We have found that \nif you delete the Help metadata before trying to restart ProductXXX, it will \nthen open successfully. This is further evidence that it is opening ProductXXX \nin the Help perspective that causes it to crash.\n\nEclipse generates a 0-length log file \n(.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.help.ui.log) when the crash\nhappens. It would be REALLY useful if Eclipse could generate a log file with \ndata in it. \n\nWe have verified this on multiple machines.

74624,Platform,Update  ,Dorian Birsan,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b""As per dorian birsan", I am entering this bug. I have tried on several occasions\nand several ways to update my Eclipse version 3.0.0 to 3.0.1. In every case the\noutcome was the same, Eclipse will not run. I can make it run by deleting the\nconfiguration directory, but then it thinks it is still in version 3.0.0 and\ncontinues to ask me if I want to update. I also end up with both the 3.0.0 and\nthe 3.0.1 versions of the files being loaded and who knows what kind of problems\nthat will create.\n\nI have entered a bug on the buildId not updating as a Runtime bug as per dorian\nbirsan. The bug # is 74621.\n\nThe update process takes 4-5 hours to download the files, there are one or more\nfiles that are 'unsigned', the update processes fails many times with a dialog\nto 'retry' and on one occasion it failed so bad I had to back up and start\nagain. Needless to say, with the overly long download times, I can only make one\nupdate attempt per day. And I have done this 4 times.\n\nI have even gone so far as to unzip 3.0.0 into C:\\Eclipse which created the\neclipse directory. Started Eclipse and went immediately to Help -> Software\nUpdates -> Manage Configuration, clicked on Scan for Updates and followed\nthe instructions to start the download. 4.5 hours later, after 8 retries\nand 1 complete restart, I get the 'Restart the Workbench' dialog box. Was\nI successful?\n\nNo. Same problem as before. The config.ini still has the original build Id\nin it and it still won't open.\n\nhere is the log file:\n\n!SESSION Sep 21, 2004 15:37:31.225

It\nsays No updates for the currently installed features(s)found, try again later.\n(sic: note no blank between \')\' and found). The option to Show the latest\nversion of a feature only is checked," and the option to Filter patches included\nin other patches is unchecked. However changing those options does not have any\neffect. All the buttons were grayed out except Deselect All (which was wierd\nbecause there was nothing to deselect) and Cancel. \n\nWhen I clicked Cancel it gave me the Automatic Updates dialog again. ""New\nupdates are available and downloaded. Do you want to review and install them\nnow?"". I selected Yes again", got the empty Search Results dialog again. Cancel,"\nrepeat. So the next time I said No. I got the first ""New updates are\navailable..."" dialog again", yes/no. Either way leads to infinite repetition.

The activation attempt is coming from the lightweight decorator.  This activation attempt is being run in a non UI thread which is causing the creation of the ColorMap instance variable to fail as it requires TaskListImages which creates an image registry which assumes it is being run in a UI thread.  The color map is used in initializeHighlighters", so the map can't just be lazily created.\n\nI have only noticed this with 3.2, so perhaps it is a JFace regression?  Still, the plugin shouldn't make assumptions about the thread it is running on.\n\nMoving the creation of the ColorMap into the constructor and wrapping it in a syncExec call does work," but locks up

The main reason this type of packaging is offered on the download page is to allow SML users to make use of the validator without having to download all COSMOS.\n\nThe package doesn't include everything though. As I am warned by the comment attached to the download that I am missing one more plugin. Which I can take if I download the entire data collection component.. That defeats the purpose of having a separate download for the SML. It would actually be much easier to just download everything at once ( one click ) then going through this two step process.\n\nThis is the note that I mention : Note: in order to run the Resource Modeling tools on their own", you will also need to install the org.eclipse.cosmos.dc.cmdbf.query plug-in found in the Data Collection Framework download file\n\nSecond issue :\n\nThe note is incorrect. Looking at the plugin dependency structure," it seems that I don't need org.eclipse.cosmos.dc.cmdbf.query but org.eclipse.cosmos.dc.cmdbf.services plugin. \n\nWhat needs to be fixed here :\noption 1 ( preferred ) : get rid of the Note above and include in the SML package the org.eclipse.cosmos.dc.cmdbf.services plugin. Since we are not Update Manager ready anyway I would not worry now what feature this plugin is part of.\noption 2 : fix the Note and make the plugin available separately from the Data Collection component ( which gets to option 1.. )""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since for MANAGED-ONLY we are always providing a platform.xml the change in policy does not need to happen until after the platform.xml is parsed. However this patch makes an assumption. The DTD allows each site to specify its own policy. My assumption is that if we are using MANAGED-ONLY we will want all sites to be that policy. So to set the default policy only the first site is checked for its policy. If the policy is MANAGED-ONLY for this site the default policy is set to MANAGED-ONLY.\n\nIf this is not satisfactory I can provide a different patch that reads the default policy from a preference.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17021,Platform,Update  ,Christophe Elek,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b""DESIGN CHANGE: from go/nogo discussions\n\nWhen installing/ cleaning up", we currently take care to process the features \nand plugins in an order that never results in broken reference structures (eg. \nfeatures referencing missing included features or missing plugins. The original \nthought was not to create broken structures. The downside of this approach is \nthat we may end up with unmanaged plugins being included at runtime, and \ninadvertently be executing by the time we want to redo the failed install, for \nexample. This would likely cause the install to fail (eg. open plugin .jar).\n\nThe alternative strategy is to reverse the processing order. This would \npotentially leave broken features, but we would never end up with unmanaged \nplugins. The broken features could then be fixed by re-installing/ updating \nthem.\n\nTo do this, install would need to do the pass-2 rename top-down (pass-1 can \nstay as is). \n\nCleanup (after failure, [Cancel]) would need to be deleting bottom-up (bu NEVER \nanything we did not actually install in the failed opreation). Need to discuss \nthis one to make sure we are in synch.\n\nAlso, when poofing up the models," we'd need to tolerate missing includes the \nway we tolerate missing plugins (ie. results in parent not being happy)""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

245220,Nebula,Grid ,Chris Gross,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b""This bug occurs due to the selection not getting cleared/checked internally prior to a submethod call is made.\n\nTo reproduce", simply follow this: \n\n1. Have some items in a table, select an item (or a cell)\n2. Call removeAll() on the table through an action or menu, etc.\n(at this point the selection is still in memory internally in the Grid)\n3. Have a mouseDownListener on the table (easiest) and call table.getSelection().\n4. Exception is thrown:\n\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Index out of bounds\n at org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:3547)\n at org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:3481)\n at org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:3452)\n at org.eclipse.nebula.widgets.grid.Grid.getItem(Grid.java:1636)\n at org.eclipse.nebula.widgets.grid.Grid.getSelection(Grid.java:2161)\n\nSuggested fix:\n\n1. getSelection() in Grid.java should make a check to see how many items there are in the table before trying to call getItem(...). If table item list size is zero then the selection is obviously not valid. \n2. It seems removeAll() should clear selection on the table as well, however;\n\nI'm not sure if the intention is to preserve selection despite an empty table, if so, at least a check to ignore an out of bounds selection should be made prior to calling getItem() so that no exception is thrown.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nCreate your own clear() method between your code and the table, in that method," call table.deselectAll() prior to calling removeAll().""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

22540,Platform,SWT ,Christophe Cornu,RESOLVED,DUPLICATE,b'This is the same or similar problem as reported in bug # 13748.

I am \nrunning IE 5.5 (5.50.4807.2300 to be exact) and the version of this library I \nhave is 5.81.4807.2300.  In comparison with others here using Eclipse \nsuccessfully, some have this same version, some slightly earlier \n(5.81.4807.1100).\n\nI have been running fine for weeks until I did a refresh and rebuild all of a \nlarge project.

Now I have the same EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION error whenever I \ntry to start up.\n\nI am running Windows 2000 (5.00.2195) SP 2 w/512MB memory.\n\nMy resulting log file (named hs_err_pid1768.log) is as follows:\n--------------\nAn unexpected exception has been detected in native code outside the VM.\nUnexpected Signal : EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION occurred at PC=0x7174d684\nFunction name=CreateToolbar\nLibrary=C:\\WINNT\\system32\\COMCTL32.dll\n\nCurrent Java thread:\n at org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.CallWindowProcW(Native Method)\n at org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.CallWindowProc(OS.java:1152)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Tree.callWindowProc(Tree.java:150)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Control.windowProc(Control.java:2733)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.windowProc(Display.java:1990)\n at org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.SendMessageW(Native Method)\n at org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.SendMessage(OS.java:1699)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Tree.destroyItem(Tree.java:334)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.TreeItem.releaseChild(TreeItem.java:467)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget.dispose(Widget.java:354)\n at org.eclipse.jface.viewers.AbstractTreeViewer.updateChildren\n(AbstractTreeViewer.java:1211)\n at org.eclipse.jface.viewers.AbstractTreeViewer.internalRefresh\n(AbstractTreeViewer.java:839)\n at org.eclipse.jface.viewers.AbstractTreeViewer.internalRefresh\n(AbstractTreeViewer.java:848)\n at org.eclipse.jface.viewers.AbstractTreeViewer.internalRefresh\n(AbstractTreeViewer.java:817)\n at org.eclipse.jface.viewers.StructuredViewer$4.run(StructuredViewer.java:748)\n at org.eclipse.jface.viewers.StructuredViewer.preservingSelection\n(StructuredViewer.java:688)\n at org.eclipse.jface.viewers.StructuredViewer.refresh\n(StructuredViewer.java:746)\n at org.eclipse.jface.viewers.StructuredViewer.refresh\n(StructuredViewer.java:708)\n at \norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.packageview.PackageExplorerActionGroup.restoreState\n(PackageExplorerActionGroup.java:183)\n at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.packageview.PackageExplorerPart.restoreState\n(PackageExplorerPart.java:642)\n at \norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.packageview.PackageExplorerPart.createPartControl\n(PackageExplorerPart.java:303)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.PartPane$4.run(PartPane.java:136)\n at org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.run\n(InternalPlatform.java:813)\n at org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.run(Platform.java:416)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.PartPane.createChildControl(PartPane.java:134)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.PartPane.createControl(PartPane.java:178)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.ViewPane.createControl(ViewPane.java:181)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.PartTabFolder.createPartTab(PartTabFolder.java:247)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.PartTabFolder.createControl(PartTabFolder.java:219)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.PartSashContainer.createControl\n(PartSashContainer.java:180)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.PerspectivePresentation.activate\n(PerspectivePresentation.java:94)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Perspective.onActivate(Perspective.java:664)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchPage.onActivate(WorkbenchPage.java:1522)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchWindow$7.run(WorkbenchWindow.java:1209)\n at org.eclipse.swt.custom.BusyIndicator.showWhile(BusyIndicator.java:64)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchWindow.setActivePage\n(WorkbenchWindow.java:1196)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchWindow.restoreState\n(WorkbenchWindow.java:1089)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.restoreState(Workbench.java:1080)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.access$7(Workbench.java:1060)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench$6.run(Workbench.java:796)\n at org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.run\n(InternalPlatform.java:813)\n at org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.run(Platform.java:416)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.openPreviousWorkbenchState\n(Workbench.java:748)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.init(Workbench.java:562)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.run(Workbench.java:1153)\n at org.eclipse.core.internal.boot.InternalBootLoader.run\n(InternalBootLoader.java:739)\n at org.eclipse.core.boot.BootLoader.run(BootLoader.java:462)\n at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\n at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:248)\n at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:697)\n at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:530)\n\nDynamic libraries:\n0x00400000 -

It is perfectly possible to navigate\nthrough the IDE (open up perspective, checkout projects from CVS, etc.), but as\nsoon as one double clicks a file in the Java/Resource perpective, instead of\nopening the file, the IDE crashes.  \n\nEclipse keeps working perfectly when using other theme engines than Crux. \nLooking at the error message eclipse generates (see lower), it looks like it is\nproblem with the crux theme engine where some precondition is violated. \n\nFurther info:\n\nPackage: gtk2-engines-crux\nSource: crux\nVersion: 1.9.5-2\nDepends: libatk1.0-0 (>= 1.2.0), libc6 (>= 2.3.1-1), libglib2.0-0 (>=\n2.2.0), libgtk2.0-0 (>= 2.2.0), libpango1.0-0 (>= 1.2.0)\n\n\nPackage: libgtk2.0-0\nSource: gtk+2.0\nVersion: 2.2.0-2\nReplaces: libgtk2.0-0png3\nDepends: libgtk2.0-common (>= 2.2.0-2), libatk1.0-0 (>= 1.2.1), libc6\n(>= 2.3.1-1), libfontconfig1 (>= 2.1), libfreetype6 (>= 2.1.3-1),\nlibglib2.0-0 (>= 2.2.0), libjpeg62, libpango1.0-0 (>= 1.2.0),\nlibpng12-0, libtiff3g, libxft2 (>= 2.1), xlibs (>> 4.1.0), zlib1g (>=\n1:1.1.4)\nConflicts: libgtk2.0-0png3 (<< 2.0.6-2), eog2 (<< 1.0.1-4), gnome-panel2\n(<< 2.0.4-1), celestia (<< 1.2.4-4), gimp1.3 (<< 1.3.7-1.1), metatheme\n(<< 0.9.7-3), libgnomeui-0 (<< 2.0.6-2), gtk2.0-examples\n(<< 2.2.0)," libgdkxft0 \n\n\nstacktrace:\n\nnephilim:~/eclipse$ ./eclipse\n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                    \n** (<unknown>:21330): CRITICAL **: file crux-draw.c: line 1017 (draw_box):\nassertion `width < 32768' failed\n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                    \n** (<unknown>:21330): CRITICAL **: file crux-pixmaps.c: line 419\n(eazel_engine_image_render): assertion `width > 0' failed\n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                    \nAn unexpected exception has been detected in native code outside the VM.\nUnexpected Signal : 11 occurred at PC=0x4CF0F44E\nFunction=(null)+0x4CF0F44E\nLibrary=/usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0\n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                    \nNOTE: We are unable to locate the function name symbol for the error\n      just occurred.

BasicNodeViewFactory has getEditingDomain() method, which should be propagated up the hierarchy. When ConnectionViewFactory creates a view, it should call this method to obtain editing doman rather then TransactionUtil.getEditingDomain(edge). The BasicNodeViewFactory way of obtaining it goes a step futher - it looks for the editing domain of the semantic element (is there is one) first.

25467,Platform,UI ,Chris McLaren,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'GTK and Motif have significant performance problems using the hidden menu in \nits current form. I looked at a profile and found that at least 700ms is spent \nin AcceleratorMenu.setAccelerators on these platforms (every time we \nrecalculate the menu - which can be as often as switching editors). I am hoping \nthat this has to do with the fact that the hidden menu is being disposed of and \nrecreated with new menu items each time setAccelerators is called. Can someone \nlook at this, and perhaps reuse MenuItem instances if that proves to be the \nproblem?',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

130051,Platform,User Assistance ,Curtis d'Entremont,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b""Now that we have dynamic content", searching needs to be updated. We cannot index filtered content because we may miss hits later on when the filter properties change, and because the environment where the docs were indexed can be different from the machine it is running on. For those interested and for future reference, here is the approach taken:\n\nFor indexing:\n\n- Index the documents unfiltered, but with all content extensions, topic replacements, and includes resolved. This immediately rules out false negatives (hits that we should get but we don't) because we have all the content there and potentially more. However we can get false positives (e.g. if I have a linux only section in my doc that I'm viewing on windows).\n- While indexing, keep track of all the filters a document is sensitive to. For single value filters like os, ws, it simply stores the name. For multi-value filters like plugin where there can be many, we store the full name and value (to denote: this doc is sensitive to whether plugin X is present or not)\n\nFor searching:\n\n- Do an initial search pass on the master index. For each hit, check what filters the doc is sensitive to. If it has any filters, it is potentially a false hit and we flag it as such. Hits that don't have filters are definite hits and we're done with these.\n- If we found potential false hits, we perform a second search pass for the potential false hits only, but on the cache index. This index has documents indexed with all content resolved and filters turned ON, unlike the master. Initially it will be empty - it is built up as needed. For each hit we check what the filterable property values were at the time we indexed this doc. If they match, the cache is up to date and it's a real hit. If it doesn't match or one of the potential false hit docs wasn't indexed, it is flagged as needing reindexing. So the whole purpose of the second pass is to determine whether the cache is up to date, and if not which parts are outdated.\n- For each doc needing to be reindexed, reindex it in the cache, filtered this time. In addition, for the filters this document is sensitive to, store the actual values of the filter properties. e.g. if the document is sensitive to os and we're running in linux, store os=linux. This will be used in the future to see whether the doc is out of sync or not.\n- Perform a third and final pass on the updated cache again. This time anything we find is a definite hit and we add it to the definite hits bucket.\n- If we had to do a second and third pass, sort the final results by score.\n\n\nThe end user implications are that searching dynamic content may be slow on the initial searches where docs with dynamic content contain the search word(s). This is because it has to reindex these docs and resolve all extensions and filter the DOM. However subsequent searches should be fast, as it will use the cache. If you change your activity enablement and you have docs that filter by activity, docs may need to be reindexed here as well.\n\nThis doesn't affect infocenter because it doesn't filter," so the second and third passes are omitted in this case and there is no need for a cache index.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems to have unlocked something, because I was able to resume\nworking," and see my breakpoint... but meanwhile it had actually killed my Eclipse in Eclipse (target was running on J9).\n\n\nFri

9430,JDT,Debug ,Darin Wright,RESOLVED,INVALID,b'We have an application that launches a command-line process using \nRuntime.exec(), then uses Process.getInputStream() to read what is output on the \nconsole.  It has a loop waiting for the stream to be ready() before actually \ntrying to read any input.  When running this application from the command line \nor from Kawa (our hopefully soon-to-be-previous Java development environment), \nthis works fine.  However, when running (or debugging) under Eclipse, the call \nto ready() never succeeds.\n\nThis is done during the startup of our application, so we are completely unable \nto run or debug using Eclipse because of this problem.\n\nHere is a small, self-contained example program that illustrates the problem.  \nIf you run or debug this in Eclipse, it will hang on the while(!in.ready()) \nloop.  If you run from the command line, using the class file compiled by \nEclipse," the program runs to completion.\n\nI am using Eclipse 2.0 latest stable build (01/25/2002) and Sun\'s JDK 1.3.0.\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class BugTest\n{\n public BugTest()\n {\n  super();\n }\n\n public static void main(String[] args)\n {\n  try\n  {\n   System.out.println(""Running command..."");\n   Process p = (Runtime.getRuntime()).exec(""command.com /C \nipconfig /all"");\n   BufferedReader in =\n    new BufferedReader(new \nInputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));\n   while (!in.ready())\n   {\n   }\n   System.out.println(""Will never get here."");\n\n   while (in.ready())\n   {\n    System.out.println(in.readLine());\n   }\n   p.destroy();\n  }\n  catch (Exception e)\n  {\n   System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n   e.printStackTrace();\n  }\n }\n}'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

316362,MPC,wizard ,David Green,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'When installing software through the MPC, the MPC consults all known p2 repositories.  To be specific, when you select a component from the market place," the MPC first computes the ""URL"" (update site) for this component", but then the install operation loads this URL plus ALL OTHER p2 repositories to determine the dependencies.  \n\nFor example, I have 10 repositories listed in my Available Software sites, and when I install a component through the market place all 10 repositories are first fetched and loaded.\n\nThis approach has a number of problems:\n\n1. Performance.  The fact all repositories are first loaded means that all repositories must be reachable (or we timeout trying).  For example, at EclipseCon where we sometimes have a dedicated server, if we hosted a marketplace on that dedicated server it would not matter because clients would still attempt to reach the outside world for each install.  This also means that as clients start using both p2 and the MPC to install things, they will begin to face serious performance hits.\n\n2. Authenticity of what I\'m installing.  If I list a URL for my component at the market place, then I assume that this URL will be the one consulted when the component is installed. However, if the same component is listed in more than one p2 repository, then it\'s anybodies guess which repository will actually provide the component.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As expected it worked great for the\ngeneration of eclipse editor plugins, but when it came to generation of\ncode for completely different purposes I had to notice, that the\ngeneration was hardcoded and not really adaptable. It only is possible to\nchange the templates for the artifacts to be generated.\n\nWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be possible to let the whole GenModel follow the\nVisitor/Visitable pattern? What actually is generated would be implemented\nin Visitors visiting the GenModel. E.g for the generation of Eclipse\neditor plugins based on a GenModel there would be a specific\nEclipseEditorVisitor which would be packaged as an extension point to the\nGenModel plugin. In order to generate completely different artifacts for\nthe GenModel it\xe2\x80\x99d be enough to implement a GenModelVisitor and package it\nas a plugin providing an extension point to the GenModel plugin.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, Eclipse pretended to download it again but the file just contains the error above once more.\n\nSo I downloaded the file and overwrote the faulty one. That\'s a bit hard because:\n\n1. I have to figure out the download path somehow (the path in the error message is just relative to the update site path)\n1. Eclipse somehow notices that the file was changed and tries to download it again. For some reason that always fails with the same error despite the fact that I can download it with wget (I tried 5 times).\n\nBut I found a workaround:\n\nFirst, I move the faulty file away. Then, I copied the download to the name of the faulty file and lastly, I reset the date with touch -r, to Eclipse couldn\'t see the difference.\n\nNow, the update worked.\n\nBut it would be better if there was a more simple way :-) Update should really check whether the file it downloads is actually what it expects.\n\nMaybe you should add file size and MD5 checksum to site.xml.\n\nI\'m wondering though, why the download in Eclipse always fails while it always works with wget :-/',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

303935,WTP Releng,releng ,David Williams,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'See bug 291637 for a broader discussion. \n\nIn Web Tools, we have historically always used the following URL for our update sites: \n\nhttp://download.eclipse.org/webtools/updates/ \n\nBut, this needs to change, for a few reasons. For one," (if we have to change it anyway) the term ""updates"" is now inaccurate or at least old-fashioned ... it is more of a ""repository"". \n\nAlso", because we now want repositories to persist forever," it is too ""high level"". For each major release", we should have one specific to that release. Also," using the ""version number"" is pretty old fashioned too", and I see no reason not to use the yearly release name. such as \n\nhttp://download.eclipse.org/webtools/repository/helios\n\n\nWhile we can (and should?) still provide \nhttp://download.eclipse.org/webtools/repoository \nas a viable URL, it is anticipated that, over the years, it would perform slower and slower, so it would be best to normally point people to a more specific one, for any particular release. \n\nAnd, while not normally advertised to most users, under the covers," we will have separate (""hierarchical"") repositories for each maintenance or off-cycle release. Currently", I\'d prefer date-time-stamp directories for these (rather than," say ""SR0"""," ""SR1"""," ""SR2"""," because then ""off cycle"" release fit in more naturally", so these very specific URLs would look like \n\nhttp://download.eclipse.org/webtools/repository/helios/201006260900/\n\nSo, the suggestion is that for feature update URLs, the value would be \n\nhttp://download.eclipse.org/webtools/repository/helios/\n\nWe\'d probably want to do this by M6," since it is ""UI"".

418432,Community,Cross-Project ,David Williams,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b'One awkward aspect of our procedure has been how to get ""affirmative"" joining of release train", and coordinating that with contribution files.

All existing target connections are unavailable and no new ones can be created.  See attached screen captures.  This installation has been used successfully since Aug 28, until today. See attached backtrace, the NPE happens in RSEDOMImporter.java:76, which corresponds to this line:\n\n    boolean defaultPrivate = getBooleanValue(dom.getAttribute(\n        IRSEDOMConstants.ATTRIBUTE_DEFAULT_PRIVATE).getValue());\n\nIt looks like the attribute ATTRIBUTE_DEFAULT_PRIVATE does not exist in the DOM in question. Workarounds: Start eclipse on a new empty workspace, or delete the profile dir: <workspace>/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.rse.core/profiles\n\nThis bug is critical because the whole RSE is not usable any more. In spite of the workarounds, data of the target connections is lost and there seems no way to restore them - only workaround is to delete the entire profile.\n\nExpected behavior:\n1.) RSE should ensure that no broken profiles are ever written. Right now,\n    I have no idea how a broken profile could be created.\n2.) When the RSEDOMImporter comes across an exception, that exception should\n    be cought and handled in a way that allows at least the RSE SystemView\n    to come up, even if it might be empty.\n\n\n-----------Enter bugs above this line-----------\nTM 2.0 I20070816-0800\ninstallation : eclipse-SDK-3.3 (I20070625-1500), cdt-4.0.0, emf-2.3.0\nRSE install  : I20070816-0800\njava.runtime : Sun 1.5.0_11\nos.name:     : Windows XP 5.1, Service Pack 2\n------------------------------------------------\nsystemtype   : Windows-local\n------------------------------------------------',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

321766,Target Management,RSE ,David Dykstal,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'We have run into situations in products where a connect and disconnect can be processing simultaneously in the same connector service. This can result in the connector service throwing an NPE due to its connection reference disappearing.\n\nConnect and disconnect operations are long running and call ISV provided routines. Connect, in particular, can wait indefinitely for user interaction. Thus," connect and disconnect in the connector service must be serialized using safe techniques employing timeouts. Simply making these operations ""synchronized"" courts deadlock.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

397995,Target Management,RSE ,David Dykstal,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'RSEInitJob is scheduled to run without constraint when RSE is initially loaded. Its purpose is to load profiles and to create any initial models objects needed in a new workspace.\n\nPart of loading profiles includes the loading of subsystem configurations. As these are loaded they may trigger code that depends on elements of the workbench that have not fully initialized.\n\nThis comes to light in 4.2, perhaps due to some scheduling change in the platform.\n\nThe platform team has recommended that we schedule this job later, perhaps exploiting the org.eclipse.ui.startup extension point.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10783,Platform,Update  ,Dejan Glozic,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'New class and interface is beeing added in 20020305-I build, \norg.eclipse.update.configuration.LocalSystemInfo/ ILocalSystemInfoListener. \nThese implement methods for obtaining available space, volume labels and types, \nplus a listener for notification when file system has changed (removable drives, \nmedia," mount points).\n\nWe should support this in the UI as follows:\n\n* install/ update wizard should show available/ required/ to-download space in \nthe site-selection list (should show as table with ""site"""," ""available space"""," \n""install size"" and ""to download size"" as columns", the last 2 are delta size \ncomputation based on the actual site content)\n\n* get volume label, possibly volume type (so we can show different icon) for the \n MyComputer tree," and any other place where we may be showing ""annotated"" local \nfile paths.\n\n* register local system info change listener ... will be called when things \nchange ... for now can simply ignore the change and do a global refresh (as when \nthe refresh action is selected)\n\nNOTE: the base java implementation of the above does not do much of anything \nuseful"," other than providing a default implementation of the apis. The full \nfunction will ""come alive"" once we add natives. The changes above are enabling \nthis.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

31887,Platform,Update  ,Dejan Glozic,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b""Every update operation is checked in 'ActivityConstraints' class where 'before' \nand 'after' states are computed to verify that the proposed operation will \nresult in a valid state.\n\nIn case of an install or update", it works as follows:\n\n1) It computes the 'before' list. It contains all the local features currently \ninstalled in the product.\n2) It computes 'add' list. It contains all the remote features that will be \nadded.\n3) It computes 'remove' list. It contains all the local features that will be \nremoved from the product.\n\nThe order is:\n\nafter_list = before_list + add_list - remove_list\n\nThis algorithm has a flaw in the actual order. 'Before' list contains only \nlocal features, while the 'add' lists contains only the remote features. After \nthe first addition, the resulting list contains a mix of local and remote. When \nthe 'remove' list is removed, it removes more features than it should thanks to \nthe behaviour of 'IFeature.equals()'. Since this method simply compares id and \nversion of a feature, it returns true when a local and a remote feature object \nwith the same id and version are compared. We use 'ArrayList'.removeAll' and in \nthis process, both the local and the remote feature is removed from the 'after' \nlist.\n\nAlthough 'ActivityConstraints' does not do the actual work - it just makes sure \nthe operation will result in a legal state - it prevents the install from \nhappening.\n\nThe fix is simple - change the order:\n\nafter_list = before_list - remove_list + add_list\n\nSince 'before_list' and 'remove_list' are compatible i.e. both contain only the \nlocal features," the result will be as desired and no excessive removal can \nhappen.\n\nThis is not a new problem - the same code existed in 2.0 release - we simply \nfound about it now. It is a very subtle issue and we stared at the code for a \nwhile before realizing what happened.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also conceivable (though probably improbable) that someone would rename the java executed to something else entirely.  I noticed the issue while I was using \'java.exe\' to be able to see any messages sent to stdout.  The toolkit should instead look for a manifest file corresponding to the executable that actually launched eclipse.

10264,Platform,Resources ,DJ Houghton,RESOLVED,DUPLICATE,"b""Customers have been reporting problems trying to build large applications \n(i.e.  more than 35 projects).\nAlthough there are several scenarios that this problems occurs", the simpliest \nway to think of this is \nthen a customer starts with a new workspace, loads the source of the large \napplication and selects Rebuild All.\nThe result is a few thousand errors in the task list.  The same source can be \nbuilt using JAVAC (i.e builds\nwith out any errors).\n\nThe difference in the build results between using JAVAC and Eclipse appears to \nrelated to circular dependencies.\nThe reasons for having circular dependencies in these large applications varies \nwith each customer.  From the\ncustomer's point of view they have many developers using this structure and \ntheir nightly builds (using JAVAC)\nbuild without any errors.  Thus they expect the IDE to be able to build the \nsame code without errors.  In addition\nwaiting for V2 of Eclipse is not a alternative for these customers.  Also \nbuilding individual projects is also not\nalternaitve since it can take a long," long time to get all the parts build \nwithout errors using elipse.\n\nTo demonstrate the problem I have created a testcase using 6 projects.  \n\nHere are the steps using Eclipse:\n\n0)  Turn off Automatic build on Windows->Perferences\n\n1)  Create the projects:\n CycleDB\n CycleMain\n CyclePeople\n CyclePolicy\n CycleServer\n CycleUtil\n\n2)  Import from the file system into CycleDB the following:\n ivjdab.jar\n vajAS400ET.jar\n vajrmi.jar\n dax.jar\n    Import from the file system into CycleServer the following:\n VAJSQLJ.jar\n\n    The jars files are in RTJars.zip \n \n3)  Import the java source into each project from the corresponding jars files \n(which are in Cycle.zip).\n    Ensure that the .classpath file is replaced during the import. \n\n4)  Select Project->Rebuild All\n\nThe result will be a few hundred build errors.\n\nHere are the steps using JAVAC:\n\n1) Ensure you have a 1.3 JDK installed\n\n2) Place the bld.cmd (which is in Cycle.zip) in the Eclpise workspace directory\n\n3) From the command line remove all the class files in the workspace directory \ntree\n   (for example issue del *.class /s from the workspace directory)\n\n4) Ensure JAVAC is on your path\n\n5) Run bld.cmd\n \nThe result is a successful build with no errors.\n\nThe zip files Cycle and RTJars are available on request.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13782,Platform,Resources ,DJ Houghton,RESOLVED,WORKSFORME,b'I came in this morning and started my machine, ready to start the week with a \nbang. Unfortunately, when I started Eclipse, an error displayed shortly after \nthe splash page was shown. I am including the contents below. An entry was also \nadded to my Eclipse directory that included log information. I am also attaching \nthose contents below. My company runs many things in a shared server \nenvironment, so I tried installing the JVM on my local machine - no difference. \nI have also tried rebooting with no success. This is a fairly old machine \n(400MHz Dell Dimension), but it was recently scratched and installed with \nWindows NT Workstation (4.0 w/SP6a & hotfixes). I have also run a complete \nhardware diagnostic and everything pertinent came out OK (errors on CD-ROM and \nDiskette drives only). I have recently had experiences when Eclipse would just \nshut down in the middle of editing or opening a java file, but most of the time \nI have been able to restart it and continue. Now, I am unsure what to do to get \ngoing again - please help.\n\n\nERROR DISPLAY CONTENTS:\n==============================\nJVM terminated.

The missing keys are in UniversalSecurityProperties.properties:\n\n# FIXME MISSING STRINGS START \nRESID_SECURITY_ALGORITHM_ERROR_     = Algorithm error in Keystore %1\nRESID_SECURITY_LOAD_KEYSTORE_ERROR_ = An error occurred when processing Keystore.\nRESID_SECURITY_KEY_LOAD_ERROR_      = Error loading key from %1\nRESID_SECURITY_INITIALIZE_ERROR_    = Error initializing keystore at %1\nRESID_SECURITY_SECURITY_PROVIDER_ERROR_ = Missing Security Provider\n# FIXME MISSING STRINGS END \n\nNote again, that the messages here were just dreamed up by me and are likely NOT correct. All messages can only occur in error messages; I did not check, though, under what circumstances the corresponding exceptions are thrown and/or if they even can ever get thrown.\n\nNote that before the fix from bug 235626, existing behavior would have replaced the NLS MEssage with its key, so instead of a proper error message users would have read RESID_SECURITY_KEY_LOAD_ERROR without a message substitution.\n\n-----------Enter bugs above this line-----------\nTM 3.0RC2 testing\n------------------------------------------------',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12574,JDT,Debug ,Joe Szurszewski,RESOLVED,WORKSFORME,b'Build 20020328\n\nThe configurations in the launch history don\'t seem to get updated when you \nchange the JRE used by the configuration.  This is best explained by showing the \nsteps I followed.  I don\'t know if this is intended behaviour, but I found it \nquite confusing!\n\n1) Setup a self hosting environment\n2) Create a launch config for Runtime Workbench using IBM JRE as the VM\n3) Perform a launch (debug mode) using this configuration, then shutdown\n4) Use Debug dropdown button," pick ""Debug Configurations...""\n5) On this page", change the JRE of runtime workbench to J9.\n6) Hit apply button, then close this dialog.\n7) Now use the debug history to try launching the runtime workbench\n\nIt fails to launch (UnsatisfiedLinkError: setClassPathImpl).  I spent quite some \ntime at this point trying to figure out why it wouldn\'t launch with J9.  \nFinally, I stumbled on the answer:\n\n8) Reopen the debug configurations dialog\n9) Select the runtime workbench," and hit the ""Debug"" button\n\nNow it launches.  After launching", the debug launch history now shows two \nidentical entries for runtime workbench.  One uses J9, and the other uses IBM \nJRE, but they are impossible to distinguish.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

262791,JDT,APT ,Walter Harley,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'A user on eclipse.tools.jdt reports extreme slowness when compiling his project if APT is enabled, even if the processor is implemented as a NoOpProcessor.  An excerpt of the forum thread follows, followed by some console thread dumps taken during a typical slowdown.\n\nNote that although APT is enabled, the call stack is not inside a processor; rather, we\'re inside AST generation.\n\nI\'m assigning this to JDT Core rather than APT, because I suspect someone from the compiler team will need to help troubleshoot.  The problem may be incorrect use of JDT APIs by APT; reassign to APT as appropriate.\n\n\n\nForum excerpts (edited together from several posts)\n\n[...] Until recently, where my IDE started becoming much less responsive. I didn\'t know what it was due to, until it became unbearable: now, saving certain files requires about 10 seconds. Turns out that disabling the annotation processing makes it recover its snappiness instantly.\n\nI did some basic profiling in my annotation processor, and found that my code was not the bottleneck. It executes, for a single file, in about a tenth of a second. Actually, even if I return AnnotationProcessors.NO_OP from my AnnotationProcessorFactory, saving is this incredibly slow.\n\nHere\'s typical stack traces of the two threads that are most active when compiling takes so long (see end of message -- and sorry for the long post!). Looks like newReconcileEnv and newBuildEnv, called by AptCompilationParticipant#processAnnotations, take a lot of time. I fail to see what would be the problem, though...\n\nI tried doing the annotation processing only on build and not on reconcile. I also tried returning an empty list for the supported annotation in the factory -- no luck, still takes ages to compile.\n\nMy annotation processor doesn\'t generate source files. The slow files are the Java files which use my custom annotations, or (apparently) other Java files which cause those annotated classes to be recompiled. This happens when I save them manually from the Java Editor, or whenever it is rebuilding the workspace.\n\nI created a new workspace and imported all projects, copying them into the new workspace with the Eclipse import wizard. Compilation was slow immediately.\n\nThere is nothing in the error log. Nothing on the terminal either.\n> Is it possible that the slowdown correlates with an increasing use of \n> annotations in your project?  I think that when annotation processing is \n> enabled, the compiler (before it even gets to processing) has to scan for \n> annotations; I wonder whether that scan is bogging down?  A couple of thread \n> dumps may help to answer that question.\nIt looks like it could be an explanation... But I\'m unsure about the \ninterpretation of the thread dumps," though.\n\n\n\nThread dumps:\n\n""main"" prio=6 tid=0x09401540 nid=0xa046c720 runnable \n[0xbfffd000..0xbffff158]\n at

Then the\nmessage box ""Confirm exit"" appears. But if I press Ok"," eclipse will not close.\nBut somtimes eclipse get\'s live back and i can continue using it. \nIf this dosn\'t work I have to kill eclipse with ""<Strg>+<Alt>+<Esc>"".\nAfter starting Eclipse again", sometimes it works fine," other times it freeze in\n at once. The worst case is when eclipse freeze in after changing some sources\nwithout saving.\n\nIn the log file there is the following Error:\n\n< Error >\n""java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread""\n</ Error >\n\nI can\'t belive that memory is really a problem"," because i\'m working on a very\nsmall project and started Eclipse with the parameter for additional memory:\n\n""$ECLIPSE/eclipse -vm $JAVA_PATH -data $WORKSPACE -vmargs -Xmx256M""\n\nAfter i started eclipse. Ktop tells me", that there is more than 650 MB free.\n\nHere is some Information about my System:\nI\'m using Suse Linux 7.3\nkernel version 2.4.20\n1 GHz Athlon with 1 GB RAM\n\nFor my Eclipse Installation," i installed the following files:\n\neclipse-SDK-RC1-linux-gtk.zip\norg.eclipse.cdt-200212181139-linux-gtk_1.0.1.bin.dist.zip\norg.eclipse.cdt-linux-gtk_1.0.1.bin.dist.zip\natk-1.2.0.tar.bz2\npango-1.0.5.tar.bz2\npango-1.2.1.tar.bz2\nglib-2.2.1.tar.bz2\ngtk+-2.2.1.tar.bz2\npkgconfig-0.14.0.tar.gz\ntiff-v3.5.7.tar.gz\njpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz\nlibpng-1.2.5.tar.gz\nj2sdk-1_4_1_01-linux-i586-rpm.bin\nj2sdk-1_4_1-doc.zip\ngdb-5.3.tar.gz      \n\nI installed the above mentioned file\n""org.eclipse.cdt-200212181139-linux-gtk_1.0.1.bin.dist.zip""\nafter i recognized that in the install configuration of the \n""Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools 1.0.1"" was somthing wrong. When i viewed the\n""Detail"" from ""Show Status"" menu", i get the information, that the feature is not\n properly configured. After installing the File this mistake was gone.\nBut my main error described at the top unfortunately stays.\n\nOk, here are some sessions of the log file with the error:\n\n< Log-File >\n!ENTRY

Nothing worked. Has nothing to do with XML encoding.

So this would avoid the need for all users to catch it.\n\n Of course, it would be better not to run out of handles in the first place, but we can\'t control this in general.\n We can only minimize the number of images we create.\n\n\nKH (8/1/2001 8:37:17 AM)\n Your proposal makes sense. Hold off making these changes until the SWT team fixes their part of this \n problem. They are going to be releasing changes that significantly reduce the number of images that need\n to be created. \n\nNE (8/8/2001 3:19:49 PM)\n Try changing ActionContributionItem to not create extra images on Win98: disabled and hot image.\n Use the hot image as the regular one.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2859,Platform,UI ,Eduardo Pereira,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b'During a ""New"" wizard", if an SWTError is thrown while building a wizard page,\nthe error is not handled, and the IDE process terminates abnormally (i.e. no proper\nshutdown allowing edit sessions to save).  This will cause data loss and perceived\ninstability in the IDE.\n\nThe problem is likely going to happen with any runtime exception, but I\'ve only\nseen it with SWTError.  In particular, an SWTError was thrown under Linux when\nCombo.setItems(list) was called where list[0] == null.  This doesn\'t cause an SWTError\nin Windows.\n\nTo reproduce this, take any New wizard (eg new Java Project). In the \ncreateControl() method that builds the wizard page content as called by \nWizard.createPageControls," manually throw an SWTError (throw new SWTError(""oops"");).  \nThis is just to simulate an actual SWTError that might be thrown for a variety of \nlegitimate reasons such as low system resources.  With that throw in place", run the \nIDE and attempt to create the new object.  When you click Next from the first\nwizard page, and it attempts to build the page we modified createControl for,\nthe IDE will simply shut down.  I expected that the error would be caught, and\nthe current operation (creating a new Java Project for example) would fail and\ninfo written to .log.\n\nHere is the stack trace that was dumped to stdout in my case:\norg.eclipse.swt.SWTError: Item not added\n at org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:1724)\n at org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:1741)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget.error(Widget.java:262)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Combo.setItems(Combo.java:1142)\n at com.ibm.etools.j2ee.common.wizard.NewJ2EEProjectCreationPage.populateEARProjectCombo(NewJ2EEProjectCreationPage.java:148)\n at com.ibm.etools.j2ee.common.wizard.NewJ2EEProjectCreationPage.createControl(NewJ2EEProjectCreationPage.java:54)\n at org.eclipse.jface.wizard.Wizard.createPageControls(Wizard.java:158)\n at org.eclipse.jface.wizard.WizardDialog.createPageControls(WizardDialog.java:485)\n at org.eclipse.jface.wizard.WizardDialog.setWizard(WizardDialog.java:835)\n at org.eclipse.jface.wizard.WizardDialog.showPage(WizardDialog.java:870)\n at org.eclipse.jface.wizard.WizardDialog.nextPressed(WizardDialog.java:648)\n at org.eclipse.jface.wizard.WizardDialog.buttonPressed(WizardDialog.java:288)\n at org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.Dialog$1.widgetSelected(Dialog.java:236)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.TypedListener.handleEvent(TypedListener.java:69)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.EventTable.sendEvent(EventTable.java(Compiled Code))\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget.notifyListeners(Widget.java:505)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.runDeferredEvents(Display.java(Compiled Code))\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.readAndDispatch(Display.java(Compiled Code))\n at org.eclipse.jface.window.Window.runEventLoop(Window.java(Compiled Code))\n at org.eclipse.jface.window.Window.open(Window.java:517)\n at org.eclipse.ui.actions.NewWizardAction.run(NewWizardAction.java:63)\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.NewWizardDropDownAction.run(NewWizardDropDownAction.java:68)\n at org.eclipse.jface.action.ActionContributionItem.handleWidgetSelection(ActionContributionItem.java:398)\n at org.eclipse.jface.action.ActionContributionItem.handleWidgetEvent(ActionContributionItem.java:352)\n at org.eclipse.jface.action.ActionContributionItem.access$0(ActionContributionItem.java:343)\n at org.eclipse.jface.action.ActionContributionItem$ActionListener.handleEvent(ActionContributionItem.java:47)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.EventTable.sendEvent(EventTable.java(Compiled Code))\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget.notifyListeners(Widget.java:505)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.runDeferredEvents(Display.java(Compiled Code))\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.readAndDispatch(Display.java(Compiled Code))\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.runEventLoop(Workbench.java(Compiled Code))\n at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.run(Workbench.java:642)\n at org.eclipse.core.internal.boot.InternalBootLoader.run(InternalBootLoader.java:810)\n at org.eclipse.core.boot.BootLoader.run(BootLoader.java:280)\n at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\n at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:119)\n at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:401)\n\nFor additional info, contact Steve Francisco (cisco@ca.ibm.com)\n\nNOTES:\n\nKH (9/20/2001 9:27:41 AM)\n Customer will fix their code.

There are SWT defects\n     that currently prevent this from happening\n\n        menu.setVisible() returns after the menu has been dismissed on Windows\n        but not on Motif\n\n        the selection callback has not been fired after returning from \n        setVisible(). Until this changes you can not immediatly dispose\n        the menu. \n\n        Once SWT issues are resovled the following will work:\n\n                pt = tb.toDisplay(pt);\n  menu.setLocation(pt.x", pt.y);\n  menu.setVisible(true); // Currently this line on works on Win32\n  // tb.getDisplay().readAndDispatch(); //S hould not be required\n  menu.dispose();\n\n     An even better optimization is not to create and the destry the menu each\n     time, the contents are static.\n\nThe second leak is in ShowViewMenu\n\n    If you follow the steps above and snapshot when the UI is empty a reference\nto a page is held onto by the ShowViewMenu. \n\n    Notice that this class keeps track of the activePage. (BTW this is very \ndangerous as it could get out of date, would  be better to look it up when you\nneed it instead of having to manage the reference)\n\n    Anyway, the activePage is only set in pageActivated(). If it is cleared in \npageClosed() the remaining referece to a page is removed and you will now be \nleak free.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

15229,Platform,UI ,Eduardo Pereira,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b'I had thought that sharing workspaces between products with different plugin \nsets was not supported due to the errors that occur when you do so. \n\nHowever I was told that my assupmtion was incorrect. So this bug is to track \nthat issue with Views and Perspectives which I assume are the province of the \nUI.\n\nThese were using JDK1.3.1 on WSAD based on eclipse 2.0 M5.\n\nI bring up WSAD and open several WSAD projects with an assortment of WSAD \nspecfic views and perspectives. Then I shut down WSAD.\n\nNow the following:\n1) Launch the base eclipse M5 against the same workspace and I have to wade \nthrough a *set of error dialogs* about views and perspectives that have gone \nmissing. When eclipse finally comes the initial perspective is a Navigator view \nand the other perspectives are still there but seem to be reset to a \ndefault ""Resource"" Perspective.\n\n2) I haven\'t yet tried this (am in the middle of setting it up features for \nWSAD) but it is possible to unconfigure a feature in the update manager so that \nthe next time you launch the workbench they don\'t exist which would give the \nsame error as in 1 above I think. I append the results of that as soon as I \nknow.\n\n\nCurrently we are on a path of recommending users not to share a workpsace among \ndifferent eclipse based products like WSAD because of these errors.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then an Internal Error dialog appears: ""An SWT error has\noccurred. It is recommended to exit the workbench. Subsequent errors may happen\nand may terminate the workbench without warning. See error log for more details.""\n\nTruer words were never spoke. An attempt to say No to that dialog just brings it\nup again", flickering madly. Unfortunately, Yes gets the same result.

This happens only when running in debug mode if you add a breakpoint at the beginning of the constructor to see current values of fields and then open Variables view to see those values. Variables view calls Object.toString() to show some nice string representation of objects and it changes not initialized cachedPath to ""/"". Then it is no longer possible for the constructor to set correct value of cachedPath as absolutePath() initializes this field once only. In my case I was able to add preferences with path ""/"" as a child of preferences ""/project"".\n\nThis is a blocker as we are not able to debug the code safely as it may change unexpectedly state of objects showing inappropriate results. toString() should not initialize the object in any way as it is mainly used for debug purposes. Adding a breakpoint inside toString() will not help as this method is called by host Eclipse instance. You may add some System.out.println() calls to see that this method is in use.\n\nYou will not see the problem when running normally (not in debug mode) as you will not have any reference to the object before the constructor returns so you will not be able to call toString() for the object.\n\nAttached patch solves the problem.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4042,JDT,UI ,Erich Gamma,RESOLVED,WORKSFORME,b'1. Create a new project.\n2. File-->Import-->Zip File.  Specify a jar that just has class files.\n3. Now select all the packages in your new project and try to delete them.  Nothing happens - the\n packages are not removed.  Select an individual package.  Try to delete it.  It is not removed.\n The only way to get rid of the packages is in the Resources View.  Is this the intent???\n\n4. File-->Import-->Zip File.  Specify the jar in Step 2.  Make sure overwrite without warning is checked.\n At one point I got duplicate packages.  Cannot recreate the duplication problem.  Not sure what\n state I was in.  I was going back and forth between the Java Perspective and the Resources\n Perspective.\n\nNOTES:\nEG (24.07.2001 21:24:14) \n there is a fix for 1.0 in build 127 for not being able to delete a package.\n need to verify that this addresses the problem.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5343,JDT,UI ,Erich Gamma,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'This is a fix candidate for 1.0\n\nChanging the name of the top-level type of a CU followed by save prompts the \nuser whether they want to rename the compilation unit as well.\n\nThe current implementation is problematic since the prompt is done inside the \ndelta processing. As a consequence, when changing a type programmatically a \ndialog can show up as a side effect.\n\nWe have removed this behaviour in the 2.0 stream since the same effect can be \nachieved with the rename type refactoring.\n\nProposal is to remove this behaviour in the 1.0 stream as well (1.0 already has \nthe rename type refactoring).',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The older PR is: \nhttp://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3750\nIt is ok to close the older PR because the menu ordering problem has been \ncorrected," but the ""missing menu items"" problem is still very much there.\n\nAs of 20020214-Stable build:\n\nGo To -> Type... is missing from the Hierarchy view\nOpen With -> is missing from Class in Packages view\nCopy Names is missing from the Hierarchy view\nCut is missing from CU in Packages view\nMove is missing from Type in Packages and in Hierarchy view\n (should be able to move the type or the whole CU)\nRun/Debug is missing from the Hierarchy view\nBut the most important missing thing from any Type is *all* of the TEAM \nfunctions", including the whole Team -> menu, and team items in the Compare \nWith -> menu, and Replace With -> menu.\n\nI will paste a bitmap of 3 menus side-by-side so that you can easily see where \nthe gaps are. In this diagram, the menu on the left is the CU menu in the \nPackages view, the menu in the middle is the Type menu in the Packages view, \nand the menu on the right is the Type menu in the Hierarchy view. Ideally, all \nmenus on Types and CUs in all perspectives should be analyzed in this visual \nmanner - I have not used the new VAJ perspective much yet (waiting for the \ntypes to be displayed in a hierarchy) so I did not analyze those menus, but I \nsuspect strongly that we will discover inconsistencies and gaps if we look.\n\nPlease, if you don\'t do anything else, add team support to Types. This was done \nin VAME and it made a huge difference. There is less mental and actual context \nswitch required. The current implementation in Eclipse reveals that there is a \nframework behind everything, and we do not want to let this show. The user \nshould have a seamless experience without so many context switches. The 90% \ncase is that the CU/Type ratio is 1:1. In the other 10% case, the tools should \nbe able to figure out what the user meant, or if it is unclear, then just ask \nthem.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

196570,Community,IPZilla ,Eclipse Foundation IPZilla inbox,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b'the multiple meanings of the ""non-epl"" keyword is misleading.  It seems to be related to both the license and the origin of the contribution.  From the keyword definition in IPzilla\n   non-epl = Contribution is non-EPL or third-party packages only.\n\nThe new CQ workflow does not clarify the matter.  People are give two choices:\n- EPL and written by Eclipse projects members (project member is a Committer or an active participant who contributes code through Bugzilla)\n\n- Not EPL and/or written by a 3rd party. If your non-EPL contribution contains nested components", please list each nested component individually in the list of packages.\n\nIn the case of EPL," what is the point of the ""active participant who contributes code through Bugzilla"" characterization?  Who defines ""active""?  Isn\'t the fact that the person is contributing code that warrants a CQ enough to say that they are active?\n\nIn the non-epl case the wording of the first sentence is ambiguous.  While I understand that the ""Not"" applies only to ""EPL"""," it could be construed as applying to the ""and/or written by a 3rd party"" part.  More significantly and in light of the EPL section", the definition of third party is unclear.  \n\nThe way I read this now is as follows:\nQ1: is this EPL or not EPL\nQ2: is the contribution from a random place that has nothing to do with Eclipse or from someone who is actually involved with Eclipse.\n\nThis separates the concerns (licensing and origin) and distinguishes between, for example, stuff from Apache and people who are actualy trying to get involved in Eclipse.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

290340,PTP,Core ,Greg Watson,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b""If ServiceModelManager.getConfiguration() is called prior to the org.eclipse.ptp.services.core plugin being loaded", Eclipse will attempt to load the plugin and call the plugin's start() method. This will call ServiceModelManager.loadModelConfiguration() to try and load the saved model state.\n\nThe problem is that loadModelConfiguration() eventually calls IConfigurationElement.createExecutableExtension() which (for unknown reasons) terminates the start() method. getConfiguration() then returns null because the model hasn't been loaded. I don't know why start() is terminated, but it must be something to do with the class loader logic.\n\nThe attached patch attempts to address this problem by moving the model loading out of the plugin start() method. Now any time a model-related method on ServiceModelManager is called, it will make sure the model is loaded first. Unfortunately this breaks some tests which assume that localModelConfiguration() will replace the existing configuration with a new one.\n\nIf anyone can think of a better way to fix the problem," please feel free.\n\nThis is a critical bug because it breaks saving/restoring resource manager state.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the context of DOT.UI (in which the layout information in the Graph could already be provided through the Graphviz executable, we would need to remove all GEF4 Layout dependencies and only rely on the Graph-adoption alone). In the context of ELK, this would allow us to properly convert between the layout info of ELK (instead of our own) and the Graph layout data. In detail, the refactoring has to comprise:\n\n1) We have to define Zest layout properties that can be used to specify position and size of nodes as well as routing of edges. The Zest content parts should listen to changes of these properties alone for refreshing their visuals, and the transaction policies should only update these properties (so that the graph model could also be stored persistet).\n\nAs Graphviz uses control points to describe the positioning of edges and we may use waypoints in other scenarios," we should simple provide ""points"" for edges and leave the concrete interpretation to the connection router (ZestProperties.CONNECTION_ROUTER). \n\n2) We need to ensure that the attributes of the layout adapters and the graph model elements are no longer bidirectionally bound", but that instead the layout information attributes are bidirectionally updated/converted upon changes. The layout algorithms should rely on the Layout properties only, the visualization and transactions in zest should only relay on the Zest attributes.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

113708,GMF-Runtime,General ,Christian W. Damus,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'The following are some of the requirements addressed by this enhancement:\n1)EMFT API - Provide a model management layer to replace the current MSL API \nin the GMF run-time. It will consist of at least two layers:  a non-Eclipse \ncore," providing primarily the ""transaction model""", and an Eclipse workbench \nintegration layer.\n2)Multi-threading - Implement a protocol for clients to read and write EMF \nmodels on multiple threads.  The protocol will not be optional, and compliance \nwill be enforced as much as is possible.  Both writing and reading are \nserialized (not concurrent), to protect structural integrity of the EMF \nmodels, including explicit and implicit changes (e.g., proxy resolution) and \ndependent infrastructures such as cross-reference indices.\n3)Model Integrity - Semantic integrity is ensured by automatic validation to \ndetect invalid changes and semantic procedures to proactively maintain \ncorrectness of semantic dependencies.  Validation constraints and semantic \nprocedures can be added to the system by clients.  They are triggered by three \ndifferent mechanisms:  EMF adapter notification," transaction pre-commit \n(was ""live"" mode in MSL)"," ""manually"" by the client (was ""batch"" mode).\n4)Batched Events - Clients are notified of groups of related changes in \nbatches", rather than as a stream of EMF notifications.  In particular, this \nallows applications to analyze change sets in their entirety.  Moreover," \nlisteners must have a well-defined ""safe"" way to make dependent changes to the \nmodel (this is related to the ""semantic procedures"" of item 2). Clients can \nlisten for only certain events of interest to them using an efficient \nfiltering mechanism.\n5)Undo/Redo - For a simplified programming model", the framework automatically \ntracks changes applied to models without the need for client code to use EMF \nedit Commands.  These changes are encapsulated in transactions/operations that \ncan undo and redo themselves.  Managed changes include both object-level and \nresource-level changes (e.g, create, load, unload). Clients may also use EMF \ncommands," and both styles are supported in the same editing domain.\n6)Editing Domain - Support cooperative editing of models by multiple \neditors/applications.  EMF resources can be shared amongst different editing \ndomains. An open question is whether objects/resources need to be traceable to \na single originating/owning editing domain.\n7)Reference Management - Enhance the EMF\'s dynamic reverse-reference mapping \nto support:\na) more advanced querying/filtering on reverse references\nb) delegation of reverse-reference lookup to pluggable index providers (such \nas a workspace index for unloaded resources)\nc) Note that this should include support for cross-editing-domain references \nas per item 5.\n8)Object Destruction - Support for ""destroying"" objects by removing them from \na resource and severing all references to them", with undo/redo and model \nintegrity support (validation to prevent incorrect destruction and semantic \nprocedures to apply dependent changes). Note that this should include support \nfor cross-editing-domain references as per item5.\n9)Protocol Escapes - Some clients occasionally have a need to work outside of \nthe normal resource management protocol.  The API needs to provide the means \nto apply model changes that are:\n  not validated\n  not enhanced by semantic procedures\n  not recorded for undo/redo\n  not sent to listeners\n  performed during an otherwise read-only transaction\n  or any combination thereof.  The framework does not guarantee \nthe safety of any of these escapes; it is assumed that clients know what they \nare doing.\n10) Eclipse Workspace - The framework provides traceability between EMF \nresources and workspace resources.  Multi-threaded access is coordinated via \nthe Eclipse jobs API and its integration with the workspace. The framework \nalso supports non-workspace resources (e.g., resources deployed in plug-ins, \nin CVS repositories, or just anywhere on the filesystem or the network).\n11) Eclipse Operations - The framework supports the Eclipse operation history \nas an undo stack for undo/redo (see item 4) of resource changes.  The API \nprovides a framework for undoable operations that automatically capture \nundo/redo information, which can be interleaved on the same history with \ndependent operations that do not modify the EMF model.  The client application \nprovides the operation history that an editing domain works with.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

468172,Papyrus,Diagram ,Christian W. Damus,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'Papyrus Mars RC1\n\nCollaborations are BehavioredClassifiers.  I find them very practical for definition of system behaviour as the context classifier for Interactions, especially (communication and sequence diagrams).\n\nIn other kinds of classifier (e.g., Class)," the Model Explorer\'s ""New Diagram"" context menu lets me create behaviour diagrams.  These create the appropriate kind of Behavior as the classifierBehavior", which is exactly what I want as a user.  But in the Collaboration, the only kind of diagram I can create is a Composite Structure Diagram.  To create a behaviour diagram I first have to create the particular Behavior and then create a diagram in it.  However, because of bug 468169, I cannot access the Behavior that I created and so cannot create a diagram for it.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create a Collaboration in a package in the Model Explorer.\n2. Right-click on the Collaboration and see what the New Diagram menu offers.\n3. Observe that the only choice is Composite Structure Diagram.\n   ==> All the same diagrams supported for Classes should be available',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The UI thread invokes save.  This saves the UML resource to disk\n   via the workspace resource framework.\n2. The workspace starts notifying resource listeners.\n3. The index manager processes resource deltas, scheduling jobs that\n   are immediately blocked waiting for access to the affected projects\n   (the files saved in these projects are still locked by the UI).\n4. The text-file buffer infrastructure in the text editor processes\n   resource deltas, during which it checks to see whether any text\n   editors need to close as a result.  This process causes the\n   workbench page to compare editors with inputs.\n5. The PapyrusMatchingStrategy for editor inputs checks the index to\n   find the root resource of whatever potential 'shard' resource is\n   referenced by the editor input.\n6. This blocks on the index, which isn't ready yet to provide an\n   answer to the query because re-indexing jobs are pending.\n\nThis is a deadlock," because the re-indexing jobs cannot proceed while the resource change notification is still in progress.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Damus,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'Papyrus RT 0.7.2.201609022000\nPapyrus UML 2.0.1.201609061203\nEclipse  4.6.0.v20160606-1342\n\nI have a Papyrus-RT installation based on the latest integration build of Papyrus 2.0.1, which for some days now has not shown updates to label decorations of any kind on files in the Package Explorer.  This is annoying for development (not seeing git status of files, seeing stale problem decorations, etc.).\n\nHowever, it also happens that the workbench hangs on attempt to open any Papyrus(-RT) model.  It turns out that the two problems are related, and caused by the Index Manager:  the label decoration update job and the workspace model index job are deadlocked on access to the static IndexManager instance at these call sites:\n\nIn the WorkspaceModelIndex::addListener() method:\n\n IndexManager.getInstance().addListener(this, listener);\n\nAnd in the CrossReferenceIndex$IndexProvider::get() method:\n\n return CrossReferenceIndex.INSTANCE.index;\n\nI have never observed this deadlock in a run-time workbench, but it is now happening consistently in my Papyrus-RT installation.  At least one other developer has also reported not seeing label decorations.\n\nA slight re-arrangement of the code that initializes the IndexManager, moving that startManager() call from the IndexManager class initializer to the job that creates the manager resolves the problem when installed in my Papyrus-RT workbench:  label decorations are normal and the Papyrus editor opens and seems to work.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
512380,Papyrus,Diagram ,Christian W. Damus,RESOLVED,FIXED,b'In the Neon.2 release, the org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.linklf bundle does not export any of its packages.  Not only is it standard practice (and required for Release Train projects) to export all public API packages, and usually also internal API packages (with the internal warning marker), but Papyrus-RT state machine diagram needs to be able to override the graphical node edit-policy provided by Link LF.  In order to do this, we need to be able to extend the DefaultLinksLFEditPolicy class, which is not exported.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
512387,Papyrus,Views ,Christian W. Damus,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b""The Advanced tab for UML elements transforms the incoming selection from a diagram with too many assumptions about objects that actually are adaptable.\n\nThe UMLPropertySection::transformSelection(Object) method doesn't attempt to object EObject adapters from IAdaptables except as a last resort", when the usual pattern in Papyrus is to attempt this adaptation first.  In particular, the handling of EditParts by obtaining the semantic element directly from the notation view doesn't account for special edit-part semantic adaptation as in Papyrus-RT, where the view references the root definition of elements that are inherited.\n\nConsequently, for inherited elements in Papyrus-RT, the Advanced properties shows the properties of the wrong element, so that any redefinition is not apparent.  It is difficult or impossible for Papyrus-RT to replace the Advanced properties contribution of the Papyrus UML Diagram Common layer," so this misadaptation needs to be fixed in Papyrus.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
516180,Papyrus,Views ,Christian W. Damus,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b""Papyrus master commit a8a5132378e073d038d8f72efe8b4ac01587567a (3 May 2017)\n\nIt was not sufficient to ensure that the Papyrus p2 repository distributes the XWT Ecore model bundle (bug 508843) to ensure that cross references from Sections in Properties Context models can resolve objects in XWT resources.  The Papyrus-RT Tooling JUnit tests are still failing with run-time exceptions", being failure to cast the AnyTypeImpls loaded instead of the proper XWT UI model to the Composite type.\n\nThe root cause is that the context resource loaded from a URI with ppe: scheme has, via relative HREFs, proxy references to XWT resources also using ppe: scheme.  Because the PropertiesCatalog resource factory registered against this scheme always creates PropertiesXMIResource instances," the outcome predicted by the TODO comment in that class occurs:  the XWT XML resource registered by the now published bundle against the 'xwt' file extension is not create because the URI scheme factory registration has precedence.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I did not see this problem with the \n0129 driver.\n\nThis seems to be what is happening in JDT:\nAfter the JavaMethodBreakpoint is created its handleEvent method gets called for \na class prepare event.  It then calls handleClassPrepareEvent which calls both \ncreateMethodEntryRequest and createMethodExitRequest.  When the exit request is \nhit handleEvent is called again which now calls handleBreakpointEvent.  This \ncalls handleMethodEvent which does not check whether the breakpoint was really \nan exit breakpoint.\n\nI also noticed in createMethodRequest the following line:\n\nrequest.setEnabled(isEnabled() && (isExit() || isEntry()))',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

41079,Equinox,Incubator ,Jeff McAffer,RESOLVED,FIXED,"b'There are really three interesting locations for bundles and their data in a \nrunning Eclipse.\n<b>Install</b> - This is where the files were laid down on disk.  There can be \nmany install locations but ideally there would be only one copy of each \nbundle/plugin.  Install locations may also be server based and contain massive \nnumbers of bundles shared by many different users.\n\n<b>Configuration</b> - configurations express a subset of the plugins available \nfrom all known install locations.  They represent a coherent set of function \nfor a particular user or usecase.  So a user might choose to have an IDE \nconfiguration containing Java and Web tooling and a ""productivity"" \nconfiguration contianing mail", IM, calendaring, word processing, ... plugins.  \nThe user then runs these different configurations independently in separate \nVMs.  Allowing parameterization etc at the configuration level allows \nconfiguration designers (e.g., users) to override installation defaults and in \neffect, create their own customized installs.\n\n<b>Instance</b> - A running configuration may have further needs for \nparameterization, preferences and metadata.  Configurations can be run on many \ndifferent instance datasets.\n\nTo the extent possible, the runtime should minimize the copying and duplication \nof data on disk.  Current products can exceed 1GB in install size so any \ncopying strategy will quickly run into difficulty.  In particular, the OSGi \nframework cannot assume that it will own or control the install location of a \nbundle.  It should be happy to be told where the bundle is.  \n\nFurther, as an optimization, it should not assume that the bundle is in a jar \nfile but rather must allow for bundles to be unjar\'d into the filesystem.  \nRunning in this mode it should be able to assume that any extraction of natives \nand other files (e.g., nested jars) will have been done by some install \nmechanism.\n\nBundleContext.getDataFile() provides access to what is effectively the \nconfiguration data area.  multiple instances of the same configuration would \n(erroneously) share this data area for their instance data.\n\nOne workaround is to have a 1:1 correspondence between configurations and \ninstances.  This is what the current Eclipse does but it causes no end of \ndifficulty.  Rather, the proposal is to have the Eclipse runtime continue to \nprovide its metadata services for the instances.  This would continue to be \nheld in the location spec by -data on the command line or user.dir.  The OSGi \nframework metadata location is largely uninteresting.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But this did not result in any problems so far.\n\nI noticed another problematic issue. In the attached files I reproduced the problematic part. Subroutine ""morton_neighbors"" receives an argument ""ndim"" and uses module ""physicaldata"""," which uses another module - ""paramesh_dimensions"". Module ""paramesh_dimensions"" declares a constant"," which has the same name as the argument of the subroutine - ""ndim"". Constant ""ndim"" from the module ""paramesh_dimensions"" does not conflict with the argument ""ndim"" of the subroutine ""morton_neighbors"""," because of the ""private"" declaration in the module ""physicaldata""", which makes all entities (variables, subprograms) of this module (including those from the used modules) to have private visibility by default. So," this code can be successfully compiled (but if we remove ""private"" declaration from the module ""physicaldata"""," the compiler will complain about an ambiguous reference to ""ndim"" in the subroutine ""morton_neighbors""). \n\nThe problem is the following: when my code tries to get definitions for a reference to ""ndim"" inside the subroutine ""morton_neighbors"""," it gets both definitions - from the subroutine and from the module ""paramesh_dimensions"""," and this results in an exception. It seems that only one definition should be associated with the reference of ""ndim"" inside the subroutine - the definition from the subroutine.\n\nAtt (FLASH): paramesh_dimensions.f90 physicaldata.f90 subroutine.f90'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore the implementation of the extraction feature has led to the following issues:\n\n- The BaseApplicationModelWizard has a dependency on the fragment case, should be implemented in the respective sub class\n- For the creation case of fragments and application models, the wizard will also offer the option to add to existing node in case the file is already existing. This does not make sense and is not properly implemented\n- The case when imports where already existing in the fragment is not implemented correctly for all cases',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
